# M4EFaD - Linking the Gut Microbiome to Neurocognitive Development in Bangladesh Malnourished Infants 
This repository is a store of code used for the production of the figures that were part of the study entitled: 'Linking the Gut Microbiome to Neurocognitive Development in Bangladesh Malnourished Infants'.

Shotgun metagenomics sequencing data filtered for human reads can be found on the NCBI-SRA: PRJNA1087376

These reads data were converted into species and functional profiles according to the Terra Worflow files in 'biobakery_analysis/'

These profiles in addition to the additional lipid, EEG, Environmental factor, Bayley, and Wolkes datasets are found in the 'Data' directory which is available upon requrest and on the manuscript's figshare page.

The codebase is organised as per the figures in the manuscript.

Downstream analysis was done using scripts found in the 'code/' directory.

All scripts can be ran using python 3.8.17.

Requirements for python package installation are detailed in 'requirements.txt'.

These can be ran by 'pip install -r requirements.txt' and should take around 5 minutes and it is recommended that you do this in a python virual environment or conda environment.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you require further details.

Theo.
